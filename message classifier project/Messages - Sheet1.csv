"Greetings from Web Enthusiasts' Club!
For ages 🐜 colonies of ants 🐜 have seamlessly constructed shelter, gathered food, or even built bridges with their bodies, why can’t 🤖 robots 🤖 learn to do the same ?

Multi-Agent Learning (MAL) makes people imagine the possibilities: teams of robots playing soccer ⚽ , building houses 🏗️ , or managing farms 🌽. 
With strength in numbers, MAL could make tasks previously infeasible for robots, possible.

But how do we correctly perform optimization in multi-agent systems ? How are they different from the traditional machine learning optimization methods where a single loss is given to optimize ? How do we incorporate interaction among our artificial agents ? 

Attend our Knowledge Sharing Session on Learning & Optimization in Multi-Agent Systems to know more.
