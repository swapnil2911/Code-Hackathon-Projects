<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

A web application which will allow users to communicate with each other for cab-sharing. The users would have to register and login to use the application. Upon authorization, they would be redirected to the main dashboard where all the requests that have been made would be visible. Also we will have a search box where the users would be able to filter requests based on their destination and source. The users would be shown the requests  that meet with particular criteria. Upon clicking on a particular request, the user would be given the option of accepting the request which upon doing so would allow them to chat with the person who initiated the request. Also we would have an initiate response button/page which would allow the users to create their own requests which would be visible to everyone else.
